# ðŸŽ® Guessing Game (Semester 3 Project)

This is my guessing game where the player will get to guess words based on the uploaded pictures by the admin and also you can guess pokemons as a fun little feature. 
It's built with a Java Spring Boot backend and a React frontend, following Clean Architecture principles.

##  Features

-  Frontend: React + Javascript
-  Backend: Java Spring Boot
-  Game logic: word guessing, hints, and score tracking
-  Authentication and session handling
-  Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- SonarQube integration with 80%+ code coverage
- MySQL database with JPA/Hibernate ORM

##  Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture**, separating:

- `frontend` (React)
- `application` (business logic)
- `domain` (models & interfaces)
- `infrastructure` (Spring Boot + DB)
